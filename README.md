# express-example
Express is a popular Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features and tools for building web applications and APIs.It simplifies the process of writing web applications by providing a set of pre-built tools and conventions for common tasks, such as handling HTTP requests, serving static files, and rendering dynamic content.

In an Express application, you define a set of routes that map to specific URL patterns, and specify what action should be taken when a client makes a request to that URL. Each route can handle a specific HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and can have middleware functions that are executed before or after the main route handler.
